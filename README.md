# latentsculpt.com — GitHub Pages starter

A super-minimal static site scaffold you can push to GitHub and publish with GitHub Pages.

## How to use
1) Create (or reuse) a repository on GitHub.
2) Push these files to the `main` branch.
3) In **Settings → Pages**, set **Source** to `Deploy from a branch` with `main / root`.
4) In **Custom domain**, enter `latentsculpt.com` (or `www.latentsculpt.com`) and click **Save**.
5) Point your Namecheap DNS to GitHub Pages (A records for `@` and CNAME for `www`).

You can delete this README once you're live.
